summary: Check if Canonical's Contributor License Agreement has been signed
description: |
  Most projects at Canonical require contributors to sign the CLA. That
  typically means that one must check to see if a contributor has signed the
  CLA, which is where this snap comes in handy.

  You only need the email address of the contributor; run the snap with the
  following:

      $ cla-check <email address>
      $ cla-check.cla-check-git REVISION..RANGE

  The exit code will be 0 if the CLA has been signed, and non-zero otherwise.
